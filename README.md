### Contains simple helper lib

Started compiling a helper lib here (I'm doing a separate thing where I solve these in languages I don't know, but I'm going to give up halfway through the month and just use python)
(maybe javascript)

But I'll attach an argsparse thing so it has the bare minimum amount of interoperability, maybe?
