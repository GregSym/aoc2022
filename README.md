# aoc2022
## Advent of Code 2022
### Contains simple helper lib

Started compiling a helper lib here (I'm doing a separate thing where I solve these in languages I don't know well enough (Rust for now), but I'm going to give up halfway through the month and just use python)
(maybe javascript)

But I'll attach an argsparse thing so it has the bare minimum amount of interoperability, maybe?

## is this a good helper lib for aoc, should I use it, etc?

no, lol. But you might wanna look at the implementation for your own. I'm not putting a lot of work into this, which makes it pretty simple to see what's happening.

There are several much better libraries if you want something with a finished cli or more comprehensive python implementation, etc.

### Here're 2 that probably work (haven't checked):

## will there be a proper ci/cd setup at some point?
if they're doing an aoc2023 then maybe at that point
